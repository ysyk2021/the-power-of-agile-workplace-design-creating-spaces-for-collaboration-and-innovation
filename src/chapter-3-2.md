# Identifying Available Space Options

Designing an agile workspace requires careful consideration of available space options. In this chapter, we'll cover strategies for identifying available space options that can be used to create a flexible and collaborative work environment.

Assessing Current Space Utilization
-----------------------------------

The first step in identifying available space options is to assess current space utilization. This involves analyzing how different areas of the workspace are currently being used. Here are some strategies for assessing current space utilization:

### Conduct Workplace Observations

Conduct workplace observations to see how employees are currently using different areas of the workspace.

### Analyze Space Utilization Data

Analyze space utilization data, such as occupancy rates and meeting room usage, to identify areas of the workspace that are underutilized or overutilized.

### Survey Employees

Survey employees to gather feedback on how they use different areas of the workspace and what changes they would like to see.

Exploring Alternative Space Options
-----------------------------------

Once you have assessed current space utilization, it's time to explore alternative space options that can be used to create a more flexible and collaborative work environment. Here are some strategies for exploring alternative space options:

### Consider Remote Work

Consider implementing remote work options to reduce the need for physical office space.

### Evaluate Co-Working Spaces

Evaluate co-working spaces as an alternative to traditional office space.

### Review Lease Options

Review lease options to see if there are opportunities to expand or downsize the current workspace.

### Assess Multi-Use Spaces

Assess multi-use spaces, such as conference rooms and break areas, to see if they can be repurposed for other uses.

Prioritizing Space Needs
------------------------

After exploring alternative space options, it's important to prioritize space needs based on the organization's goals and objectives. Here are some strategies for prioritizing space needs:

### Identify Key Business Objectives

Identify key business objectives and prioritize space needs that align with those objectives.

### Consider Employee Needs

Consider employee needs, such as collaboration and privacy, when prioritizing space needs.

### Evaluate Budget Constraints

Evaluate budget constraints and prioritize space needs based on cost-effectiveness.

### Determine Timeline for Implementation

Determine the timeline for implementation and prioritize space needs that can be completed within that timeframe.

By assessing current space utilization, exploring alternative space options, and prioritizing space needs, you can identify available space options that can be used to create a flexible and collaborative work environment. Remember to conduct workplace observations, analyze space utilization data, survey employees, consider remote work, evaluate co-working spaces, review lease options, assess multi-use spaces, identify key business objectives, consider employee needs, evaluate budget constraints, and determine a timeline for implementation.
